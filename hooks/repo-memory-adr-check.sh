# Prints ONE line when a commit looks architecturally significant and no ADR index
# moved with it. Never writes, never blocks, never fails a commit: post-commit runs
# after the commit exists, so a non-zero exit here would only produce noise. Every
# path returns 0.
#
# A commit touching architecture without an ADR is frequently correct — the decision
# may already be recorded, or may not qualify. This is a reminder, not a gate.
